# Audio Equalizer: JS + CSS + HTML

An audio visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) was ised to analyze audio frequencies in real-time and dynamically update a grid-based visualization based on the intensity of different frequency bands. You can upload your own audio or select from a predefined list os songs chosen by me.

## Postscriptum

This application was given as a task during the selection process for the position of JavaScript Developer Intern in one of the Polish IT companies.

Task description:

> _In this test task you need to create an html page that contains grid and the ability to upload an audio file. Once the file is uploaded, it should be possible to play it. The grid should respond to sound waves and display them in some color. You are free to choose the grid size, number of cells, colors, and file extensions. Knowledge of frameworks is not essential for us and therefore we expect that the task will be completed using HTML/CSS/JS. If you are familiar with any framework, you can use them, but it does not provide any advantages at this stage. Please upload the final result to GitHub and share the link with us._
